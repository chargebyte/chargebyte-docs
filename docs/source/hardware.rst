EIA-485
=======

Overview
--------

In order to connect Charge Control C to an internal peripheral (e.g. smart meters, display and RFID readers),
the board supports up to two EIA-485 interfaces.
The EVerest stack ships with included support for some peripheral devices.
The baud rate of each EIA-485 interface is configurable up to 115200 bps.

Supported Peripheral Devices
----------------------------

The EVerest charging stack supports several peripheral devices out-of-the-box.
The EVerest charging stack support is provided in the form of different modules , i.e. "GenericPowermeter",
"SL032ModbusTokenProvider", "PowermeterIskra_WM3M4C".

Some of this modules need to be connected to the module "SerialCommHub", provided by EVerests charging stack.
This module is responsible for the low level communication (Modbus).

The configuration of the *SerialCommHub* module can be found on EVerests documentation platform:
https://everest.github.io/nightly/_generated/modules/SerialCommHub.html.

**Note:** It should be avoided to use different protocols on the same connector.

Since Charge Control C can be freely programmed, it is possible that customers add additional device
support on their own, either by writing a customer EVerest module or adapting a model for GenericPowermeter.

The following table documents the default communication parameters for supported Modbus peripherals.
Usually, these defaults are derived from the peripherals default settings to allow Plug & Play.
But especially in cases where a implementation supports several models (i.e. GenericPowermeter),
it must be cross-checked that the connected peripherals (default) settings matches - adapt the configuration
of the peripherals and/or change the configuration of SerialCommHub to make it work.

Supported Electricity Meter Measurands
--------------------------------------

While the supported electricity meters all use Modbus as communication protocol, there are differences in the
used EVerest modules and supported measurands by the meters.

|

**GenericPowermeter**

The GenericPowermeter module, delivered by EVerest charging stack, uses different "model" files to define
individual Modbus addresses, used to readout different measurand values.
The model files are located under */usr/share/everest/modules/GenericPowermeter/models* on root file system.

Currently supported measurands by GenericPowermeter:

* energy_Wh_import (L1, L2, L3)
* energy_Wh_export (L1, L2, L3)
* power_W (L1, L2, L3)
* voltage_V (L1, L2, L3)
* reactive_power_VAR (L1, L2, L3)
* current_A (L1, L2, L3)
* frequency_Hz (L1, L2, L3)

**Note:** A description of GenericPowermeter can be found in EVerests documentation:
https://everest.github.io/nightly/_included/modules_doc/GenericPowermeter.html

General Assumptions
-------------------

An EIA-485 bus is not considered a plug and play bus. It is assumed that peripheral devices are connected before
powering the charging station, or at least power up simultaneously with the Charge Control C board.


Main PLC
========

This device supports 10 Mbit/s HomePlug Green PHY™ power line communication on mains.
This interface is available (if present) as eth2. Please note, that for security reasons this
interface does not ship from factory with the Network Management Key (NMK) set to "HomePlugAV" like
traditional powerline devices did for a long time to ease installation. During the manufacturing process,
a random NMK is generated for each device and installed as factory default setting.
This prevents attackers from accessing the device over mains powerline with a well-known NMK.

Pairing
-------

When your HomePlug compatible companion is already setup and working, you are ready to join the powerline network.

For this you need to pair the Charge Control C with your HomePlug compatible companion.

There are currently two different ways of pairing PLC devices with Charge Control C.

|

**Putting Into Service The Powerline Connection By Means Of The Push Button Method**

The push button pairing method is the most famous method. Charge Control C has no push button to activate
this method, but the push button can be simulated with on-board tools.

    1. Press the powerline security button on the companion (e.g. wallplug adapter) to start the pairing process.
    2. Run the following command on Charge Control C - this emulates pressing the pairing button of the \
       evaluation board:

        .. code-block:: sh

         root@tarragon:˜ $ plctool −B join −i eth2
         eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Join Network
         eth2 00:01:87:FF:FF:2B Joining ...
         root@tarragon:˜ $

    3. You should see the remote powerline adapter after a short while:
        .. code-block:: sh

         root@tarragon:˜ $ plcstat −t −i eth2
         P/L NET TEI −−−−−− MAC −−−−−− −−−−−− BDA −−−−−−  TX  RX CHIPSET FIRMWARE
         LOC STA 002 00:01:87:FF:FF:2B 00:01:87:FF:FF:FE n/a n/a QCA7000 MAC−QCA7000−1.1.3.1531−00−20150204−CS
         REM CCO 001 00:0B:3B:AA:86:55 E0:CB:4E:ED:1F:53 009 009 INT6400 INT6000−MAC−4−1−4102−00−3679−20090724−FINAL−B
         root@tarragon:˜ $

    4. You have successfully created a powerline connection.

|

**Putting Into Service The Powerline Connection Using Software**

You can also add the device by means of DAK (Device Access Key, often also called device password or security ID)
to an existing powerline network or couple it with a powerline Ethernet adapter. The DAK is indicated in the
device labels 2D DataMatrix code of the Charge Control C. It consists of 4 x 4 letters, separated by hyphens.

1. Note this DAK and install the device in the power grid.
2. After the device has been put into service, you can add the device to the existing powerline network using the \
   software of your powerline companion (e.g. FRITZ!Powerline or Devolo Cockpit for powerline ethernet adapter as \
   powerline companion).
3. In doing so, the DAK is to be entered.
4. Please refer to the documentation of your powerline companion for further information about this process.


Control Pilot / Proximity Pilot
===============================

For ISO 15118 / DIN 70121 compliant communication between EVSE and PEV, Charge Control C supports CP (control pilot)
and PP (proximity pilot)
signaling including Green PHY communication. This Green PHY communication is available on interface eth1.

Since for EVSE/EV communication only IPv6 SLAAC is required, there is no further configuration (IPv4 etc.)
necessary for this Linux interface.

The implementation of the Control Pilot and Proximity Pilot is included in EVerest module *CbTarragonDriver*.

In order to use Highlevel communication the EVerest modules *EvseV2G* and *EvSlac* must be considered.
The configuration parameters can be found on EVerests
documentations platform: https://everest.github.io/nightly/_generated/modules/EvseV2G.html
and https://everest.github.io/nightly/_generated/modules/EvseSlac.html.

**Note:** The Charge Control boards use a Qualcomm Atheros QCA7000 chip for Green PHY communication on CP line.
The shipped QCA7000 firmware configuration contains a default set of prescalers which influence the
CP signal level (,,loudness”).
It is recommended to re-check these settings in customer’s specific setup and environment and tune them
accordingly if necessary.


Locking Motors
==============

Charge Control C provides connectors for 2 locking motors. Currently only the connector *X9* is supported by the
Charging stack.

To use locking motors the EVerest module *CbTarragonPlugLock* is needed. The CbTarragonPluglock module is a
generic module and can be used for different pluglock motors.
Therefore, it's possible to adapt voltage threshold values used to detect locked and unlocked positions.

**Note:** The feedback type describes which state the feedback switch has when the plug lock is in unlocked state.


Configuration For Plug Locks Without Feedback
---------------------------------------------

Using Plug Lock devices without feedback the configuration must be adapt as followed:

    - Value
  * - unlocked_threshold_voltage_min

  * - locked_threshold_voltage_min
    - 0
  * - locked_threshold_voltage_max
    - 3300


Logical Behavior
----------------

The locking motor outputs (M- and M+) are controlled via GPIO (IN1 and IN2) with a logical behavior.

.. code-block:: sh

    M+ = IN1 ∧ ¬IN2
    M- = IN2 ∧ ¬IN1

Additionally, for the X9 interface IN1 must be inverted

.. figure:: _static/images/motor_logic.svg
    :width: 200pt

    Motor Logic

**Note:** Since the enumeration of the IIO device depends on all connected devices, it is not guaranteed that
the ADC is always iio:device0.
Therefore, the name of the IIO device should always be checked (name must be 2198000.adc).

In case of system shutdown, module *CbTarragonPluglock* provides the observation of capacitors voltage,
responsible for driving plug lock without external power supply.


Relays

1-Wire
======

This is a generic 1-Wire interface. It is realised with an I2C to 1-wire bridge.
The bridge is handled by the DS2484 1-Wire Linux driver and provides the interface /sys/bus/w1/.

’Application Note 7 - Charge Control C - Thermal Management’ shows an example of how to use the 1-Wire bridge.
Since Charge Control C can be freely programmed, it is possible to add device support on your own.

======================

.. _digital_input:

Digital Input
-------------

Charge Control C supports up to six digital inputs. All digital inputs have one common adjustable reference
level from 0 V until +12 V.
To make the digital inputs working EVerest module *CbTarragonDIs* is needed.

The reference voltage can be set through the threshold voltage defined in *CbTarragonDIs* configuration.

To use the digital inputs in Linux userspace, use the *libgpiod* tools (i.e. gpioinfo, gpioget, ...).
This library can also be used in own module implementations (see https://libgpiod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Following example should show a read out of GPIO with GPIO line name *DIGITAL_IN_2*:

1. Get info about available lines

.. code-block:: sh

    root@tarragon:˜$ gpioinfo
    ...
    gpiochip3 - 32 lines:
    ...
    line  26: "DIGITAL_IN_2"  input
    ...

2. Get value of a specific GPIO line

.. code-block:: sh

    root@tarragon:˜$ gpioget --as-is --by-name DIGITAL_IN_2
    "DIGITAL_IN_2"=inactive

**Note:** If a GPIO line is already used by EVerest modules the console output will show following:

.. code-block:: sh

  gpioget: unable to request lines: Device or resource busy


Digital Output
--------------

4-Wire-Fan
==========

Charge Control C uses common tools like the hwmon/ thermal framework of the Linux Kernel.

As per default, Charge Control C only uses the thermal sensor on the i.MX6ULL SoC and tries to regulate the
temperature via the X3 fan connector. The responsible program is the shell script "fancontrol" (taken from lmsensors)
which is started automatically during boot on Charge Control C 300.


.. _board-connections:

*****************
Board Connections
*****************

Charge Control C has 14 connectors (X1...X14) and three pinheaders (JP1...JP3) as shown in Figure
connectors of Charge Control C.

The pinheaders are for configuring (JP1), debugging (JP2) and expanding (JP3) purposes.

The connectors are used to establish the connection to the external EVSE periphery.
