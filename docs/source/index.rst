Welcome to Charge SOM User Guide!
=======================================================

**Charge SOM** is an IEC 61851 and ISO 15118 compliant charging controller, born to beat in
every kind of electric DC vehicle charging station. This user guide explains the possibilities of
setting up such a system with the Charge SOM, based on the open source charging stack 
EVerest.

This documentation starts with a short introduction and then goes straight into a hands-on chapter
:doc:`getting_started` with a simple example of how to set up a simple DC charger based on the
Charge SOM Evaluation Kit.
